<!--What we do-->
<section class="">
  <h2>What We Do</h2>
  <div class="">
    <div class="">
      <p>Each year, FLY helps more than 2,000 youth who are part of the Santa Clara and San Mateo juvenile justice system or are “at-risk” of entering the system, to develop important life skills like empathy, problem solving and anger management in order to gain an understanding and respect for a legal system that previously only seemed punitive. FLY youth are also connected with positive adult role models whose support and guidance help them realize their potential and set goals for their future.</p>
      <p>Improving the juvenile justice system requires trust and mutual respect. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <p>FLY programs are well-respected by juvenile justice system staff, including judges, district attorneys, probation officers and police.</p>
      <p>As a result, FLY and FLY youth are regularly invited to participate in conversations about how the system can become more effective and humane. One of our greatest accomplishments, in addition to helping youth transform their lives, is to have become an invited guest at the table to discuss issues of juvenile justice reform.</p>
