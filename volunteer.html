    <p class="mega push-0">Our fantastic network of volunteers has helped us achieve incredible results! Last year alone, 178 volunteers provided nearly 8,000 hours of service.</p>
    <p class="mega bold">Interested in volunteering?</p>
    <p class="mega pad-b">We are always looking for energetic individuals who are interested in becoming a mentor, facilitating a law/life skills class, or contributing special talents and skills like photography.</p>
    <h2 class="zetta pad-t-2">INVEST IN A FLY YOUTH: BE A MENTOR</h2>
    <ul class="mega">
      <li>Mentors are matched with a youth who is on probation and/or struggling with drug or alcohol use.</li>
      <li>Mentors must be 21 years or older</li>
      <li>Mentors meet with their mentees one-on-one weekly.</li>
      <li>Mentors participate in free monthly activities with their mentees throughout the year, such as white water rafting, laser tag, ice skating, and a high ropes course.</li>
      <li>Because building trust and sparking change takes time and consistency, mentors must be willing to make a 12-month commitment.</li>
    </ul>

      <li>Classes meet once a week for approximately 12 weeks.</li>
      <li>No prior legal education or experience is necessary — FLY provides a well-developed curriculum and training.</li>
