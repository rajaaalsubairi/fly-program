  - sub: How Does the Leadership Training Program Benefit Youth?
  - desc: '<p class="subp">During the program year, youth begin by completing an assessment that identifies their greatest barriers to living a crime-free, self-sufficient life. A FLY case manager then works with the youth to create and execute an individualized plan to address these barriers and build skills to sustain healthy behaviors. Case managers work one-on-one with youth as they set and achieve goals.</p> <p class="subp">Youth also receive leadership training in groups, kicking off the year with a wilderness retreat that builds self-confidence, communication skills, collaboration, and positive peer relationships. Together youth in the program engage in pro-social activities and plan service learning projects where they discover how to build on and redirect their strengths as positive leaders.</p> <p class="subp">In our Leadership Training Program each year:</p> <ul><li class="subli">70-80% of our youth do not sustain a new charge during their program year</li> <li class="subli">60-80% of eligible high school seniors earn their high school diplomas or GEDs</li></ul> <p class="subp">As summarized by one Leadership Training Program graduate: “Before FLY we were hopeless and lost children. Now with FLY’s help, we are on our way to becoming successful adults.”</p>'

  - sub: How Does the Leadership Training Program Benefit the Community?
  - desc: '<p class="subp">Each year, youth provide over 4,000 hours of community service and reach over 1,500 people with community service projects like: reading stories to kindergarten children; helping restore homes for seniors; helping feed the homeless; and speaking to middle school students about the dangers of drugs, gangs, violence, and crime. Over 90% of these middle school students report that because of what they heard they are less likely to break the law. <p class="subp">“It was only by doing community service, that I realized there really is a good person inside.” – FLY Youth</p> <p class="subp">For more information on the Leadership Program, contact Vince Cabada at <a href="mailto:vince@flyprogram.org">vince@flyprogram.org</a>.</p>'
