ptitle: Mentor Program
pintro: This program serves youth on probation in Santa Clara County, many of whom struggle with substance abuse. The program matches highly trained volunteer mentors one-on-one with youth. FLY mentors are often the first positive and healthy adults our youth have had in their lives.

subheadings:
  - sub: How Do Mentees Benefit From the Mentor Program?
  - desc: '<p class="subp">Youth learn to judge their choices and have a consistent sounding board and caring person in their life. As a result, they make better life decisions. Mentees receive</p> <ul><li class="subli">One-on-one attention, support, and consistent encouragement from a volunteer mentor.</li> <li class="subli">Monthly FLY-sponsored group activities for mentors and mentees, such as horseback riding, bowling, and white water rafting.</li> <li class="subli">Attendance and advocacy at the mentee’s court hearings and school functions.</li> <li class="subli">Case management from a FLY staff member who helps the mentee set and achieve goals and supports the match.</li></ul>'  

  - sub: What FLY Alumni say
  - desc: '<p class="subp">A former FLY client said, “Now I am following up on job interviews, and following up at school even when I don’t want to. And now I get along better with my mom because my mentor encouraged me to talk to her.”</p> <p class="subp">Another shared, “I am stronger. I can say I don’t want drinking and drugs, and I can think about consequences.”</p>'

  - sub: What Stakeholders say
  - desc: '<p class="subp">Former Juvenile Court Judge Eugene Hyman shared: “FLY is important because most of these kids don’t trust anyone. They do need hands-on attention. And that is what FLY mentors give them- someone they can count on and trust and have a positive relationship with. Without FLY, I know I would see far more repeat offenders. Not having FLY would be a tragic loss. In a year of probation, the probation officer can change, the judges can change, and the only person that doesn’t change is the FLY mentor. I depend on the mentors of FLY.”</p> <p class="subp">For more information on the Mentor Program, contact Mary Ann Van Westbroek at <a href="mailto:maryann@flyprogram.org">maryann@flyprogram.org.</a></p>'
