      <p class="subh2">HISTORY</p>
      <p class="subp">In 1996 a Stanford law student, Christa Gannon, helped start a volunteer program in which law students taught legal education to youth incarcerated in Santa Clara County’s Juvenile Hall. At the end of the program, Christa asked the youth to help her design programs that they felt would prevent juvenile crime. They recommended developing a course to help troubled youth understand the law, giving at-risk youth positive role models, and creating opportunities for youth on probation to do something positive for their communities. In 1998, Christa received the George Soros Foundation award, a two-year fellowship to pilot these ideas, allowing her to bolster the youth’s input with best practices in youth development and crime prevention. The result was innovative outcome-based and research informed programs that inspire and empower youth to alter the trajectory of their lives. The programs were so successful that when the fellowship ended in 2000, Christa incorporated the project into a nonprofit.</p>
      <p class="subp">When FLY began, it had one staff member, five volunteers, 25 clients and a budget of $32,500. Today, Christa serves as FLY’s Founder and Chief Executive Officer with 50 staff, over 200 volunteers, and a budget of $5.1 million. FLY serves more than 1,000 probation and at-risk youth, and 1,000 middle school youth at risk of system involvement. To this day the bedrock of what FLY provides is what our incarcerated youth first suggested – a range of programs including legal education, leadership training, and one-on-one mentoring.</p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">THE NEED FOR FLY</h2>
      <p class="subp">AMERICA INCARCERATES MORE CHILDREN THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.</p>
      <p class="subp">A study of local incarcerated youth found that:</p>
      <ul class="subul2">
        <li>91% do not have positive adult role models in their lives.</li>
        <li>83% do not have basic life skills to resist peer pressure and make healthy choices.</li>
        <li>78% have experimented with marijuana; 62% have used cocaine, heroin, or amphetamines.</li>
        <li>Over 80% are minority youth who have significantly disproportionate rates of arrests, incarceration, and probation failure.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="subp">And on average each year in Santa Clara, San Mateo, and Alameda Counties, 10,000 kids are arrested.</p>
      <p class="subp">The resulting financial costs are significant:</p>
      <ul class="subul2">
        <li>Local counties spend approximately $525 a night per incarcerated youth.</li>
        <li>Society pays an estimated $1.7 million for each youth who drops out of school and becomes involved in a life of crime.</li>
      </ul>
