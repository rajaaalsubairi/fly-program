      <p class="pageintro">At FLY, we believe that ALL our children deserve a chance to become more than their past mistakes. Dedicated to breaking the cycle of violence, crime, and incarceration of teens, FLY works with youth ages 15-18 in the juvenile justice system and those at risk of entering the system. FLYâ€™s innovative programs include legal education, leadership training, and one-one-one mentoring. These programs drive towards measurable outcomes. Our programs equip youth to alter the trajectory of their lives, which creates a safer, healthier, and happier community for everyone.</p>
