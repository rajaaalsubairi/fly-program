      <p class="mega">FLY is committed to working with youth ages 15-18 who are in the juvenile justice system or at-risk of formal system’s entry to inspire them to change the trajectory of their lives, build their assets and skills, and ultimately reduce their delinquent behavior. FLY’s innovative programs include legal education, leadership training, and one-on-one mentoring and drive toward measurable outcomes.</p>
      <p class="mega">After completing FLY’s 12-week Law Program, youth who need additional support to change their lives are invited to join the Leadership Training Program.</p>

      <h2 class="zetta">How Does the Leadership Training Program Benefit Youth?</h2>
      <p class="mega">During the program year, youth begin by completing an assessment that identifies their greatest barriers to living a crime-free, self-sufficient life. A FLY case manager then works with the youth to create and execute an individualized plan to address these barriers and build skills to sustain healthy behaviors. Case managers work one-on-one with youth as they set and achieve goals.</p>
      <p class="mega">Youth also receive leadership training in groups, kicking off the year with a wilderness retreat that builds self-confidence, communication skills, collaboration, and positive peer relationships. Together youth in the program engage in pro-social activities and plan service learning projects where they discover how to build on and redirect their strengths as positive leaders.</p>
      <p class="peta">In our Leadership Training Program each year:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="mega">70-80% of our youth do not sustain a new charge during their program year</li>
        <li class="mega">60-80% of eligible high school seniors earn their high school diplomas or GEDs</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mega">As summarized by one Leadership Training Program graduate: “Before FLY we were hopeless and lost children. Now with FLY’s help, we are on our way to becoming successful adults.”</p>

      <h2 class="zetta">How Does the Leadership Training Program Benefit the Community?</h2>
      <p class="mega">Each year, youth provide over 4,000 hours of community service and reach over 1,500 people with community service projects like: reading stories to kindergarten children; helping restore homes for seniors; helping feed the homeless; and speaking to middle school students about the dangers of drugs, gangs, violence, and crime. Over 90% of these middle school students report that because of what they heard they are less likely to break the law.
      <p class="mega bolder">“It was only by doing community service, that I realized there really is a good person inside.” – FLY Youth</p>
